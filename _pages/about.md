Starting from April 2021, I will become a Ph.D. candidate supervised by Prof. Tomoki Toda in [Toda Laboratory](https://www.toda.is.i.nagoya-u.ac.jp) at the [Graduate School of Informatics](https://www.i.nagoya-u.ac.jp/graduate-school-of-informatics/), Nagoya University. I will receive M.S. in the Graduate School of Informatics, Nagoya University at March 2021. Prior to studying at N.U., I received B.S. in Computer Science and Information Engineering from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/) in June 2018.

From July 2017 to March 2019, I was a research assistant at the _Institute of Information Science in Academia Sinica_, Taipei, Taiwan with advisor Prof. [Hsin-Min Wang](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/whm/). Form August 2019 to September 2019, I interned at the _NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation_ under the supervision of Prof. [Hirokazu Kameoka](http://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/people/kameoka.hirokazu/index-e.html).

I received the **Research Fellowship for Young Scientists (DC1)** from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), which will last from April 2021 to March 2024. I co-organized the [Voice Conversion Challenge 2020](http://www.vc-challenge.org/). I was honored the **Best Student Paper Award** in the 11th International Symposium on Chinese Spoken Language Processing (ISCSLP), 2018 _(By the way that was the first time I presented my work in an international confrence)_. I am also a reviewer of several journals including IEEE SPL, IEEE/ACM TASLP, Neural Networks, etc.

My research interests include speech processing and machine learning. In particular, I am currently working on **voice conversion** using deep neural network based models.

I also love street dancing (locking). My team participated in a national dance contest.
