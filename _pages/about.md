I am a master student supervised by Prof. Tomoki Toda in [Toda Laboratory](https://www.toda.is.i.nagoya-u.ac.jp) at the [Graduate School of Informatics](https://www.i.nagoya-u.ac.jp/graduate-school-of-informatics/), Nagoya University starting from April 2019. Prior to that, I was a research assistant at the Institute of Information Science in Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan with advisor Prof. Hsin-Min Wang. I received B.S. in in Computer Science and Information Engineering from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/) in 2018.

I co-organized the [Voice Conversion Challenge 2020](http://www.vc-challenge.org/). I was honored the Best Student Paper Award in the 11th International Symposium on Chinese Spoken Language Processing (ISCSLP), 2018. 

My research interests include speech processing and machine learning. In particular, I am currently working on **speech synthesis** and **voice conversion** using deep neural network based models.

I also love street dancing (locking). My team participated in a national dance contest. Check out the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfGe7zuQ5g).
